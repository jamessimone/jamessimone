# Give Me The Lowdown

Hi! Thanks for visiting my Github profile. I'm a SFDC consultant and .net/TypeScript enthusiast.

I'm the author of:

- the sci-fi/fantasy novel [A Good Thing Never Stops](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Thing-Never-Stops/dp/153788963X/)
- the ongoing Salesforce Apex programming series, [The Joys Of Apex](https://www.jamessimone.net/blog/joys-of-apex/) (mirrored on [coding.blog](https://james.coding.blog/)). I'm always looking for quality SFDC content for the Joys Of Apex â€” you can [reach out](https://www.jamessimone.net/contact/) if you're interested in contributing a guest post(s)!
- [Rollup](https://github.com/jamessimone/apex-rollup), the free & open-source Salesforce custom rollup solution
## Salesforce Repos

There are a number of repositories I maintain related to Apex that may strike your fancy:

- [Apex Rollup](https://github.com/jamessimone/apex-rollup) - free, CMDT/Invocable/Apex-driven rollup solution aiming to deprecate DLRS. One line of code to install.
- [Apex Mocks](https://github.com/jamessimone/apex-mocks-stress-test) â€” started off as a comparison between a small CRUD wrapper and the larger FFLib library; there are now many branches related to specific Joys Of Apex posts
- [lwc-modal](https://github.com/jamessimone/lwc-modal) â€” an accessible, composable Lightning Web Component Modal that can be dropped in to any project
- [lwc-paginator](https://github.com/jamessimone/lwc-paginator) â€” another drop-in LWC, this time for pagination
- [dmc](https://github.com/jamessimone/dmc) â€” forked from Kevin O'Hara, the legend. I've kept DMC up-to-date because I enjoy its CLI far more than SFDX, and there are some things (like profile retrieves, and tooling API deploys) that DMC still does far better than SFDX (but believe me, I'll be the first person to take those words down when SFDX gets to a good point!)

## Gatsby Plugins

I've written or contributed to several [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) plugins, in addition to contributing to Gatsby itself:

- [gatsby-remark-google-analytics-track-links](https://github.com/jamessimone/gatsby-remark-google-analytics-track-links) â€” adds the ability to use GA from links created from your Markdown
- [gatsby-remark-codefence](https://github.com/jamessimone/gatsby-remark-codefence) â€” brings Codefence syntax highlighting and interactive code sessions into your site by replacing code snippets in Markdown with Codefence HTML
- [gatsby-remark-footnotes](https://github.com/jamessimone/gatsby-remark-footnotes) â€” allows you to customize the style applied to your footnote markers in Markdown

## âœ¨ Other Work âœ¨

I've worked on a variety of e-commerce sites, using everything from Wordpress and Shopify to in-house React / .net MVC / Angular solutions. You can see some of my work on:

- [EF Ultimate Break](https://www.efultimatebreak.com/)
- [Cat Tongue Grips](https://cattonguegrips.com/)
- [Kokopelli Packrafts](https://kokopellipackraft.com/)
- [Wacaco](https://www.wacaco.com/)

In addition, I also run the adventure travel blog [She & Jim](https://www.sheandjim.com/), which includes a fantastic recipe section ðŸ¤¤.
